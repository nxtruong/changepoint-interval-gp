# changepoint-interval-gp
Changepoint interval regression with Gaussian Processes.

- Working code in Matlab: `gaussian_process/matlab`.  Julia code (in `gaussian_process`) doesn't work as expected.
- Data: [Neuroblastoma data set](https://github.com/tdhock/neuroblastoma-data).  The data should be in a directory at the same level as this code directory, e.g., if you have `~/work/changepoint-interval-gp` then the data should be in `~/work/neuroblastoma-data`.
- Requires GPML toolbox for Gaussian Processes: http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/code/matlab/doc/
